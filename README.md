# Detecting-money-laundering-accounts-in-OSN
This is a Java Based Application for detecting moneylaundering accounts in OSN

## Overview  
Virtual currency in Online Social Networks (OSNs) plays an increasingly important role in supporting various financial activities such as currency exchange, online shopping, and paid games. However, this rise in virtual currency transactions has attracted malicious actors who exploit these platforms to launder virtual currency for profit. These activities introduce significant financial losses for victim users and threaten the stability of the ecosystem.  

This project aims to detect malicious OSN accounts engaged in laundering virtual currency by analyzing behavioral patterns and transactional data. The framework focuses on identifying laundering networks using three key dimensions:  

- **Account Viability** – Measures the operational consistency and activity of accounts.  
- **Transaction Sequences** – Analyzes the flow and patterns of transactions between accounts.  
- **Spatial Correlation** – Examines the structural relationship among connected laundering accounts.  

## Objectives  
- Develop a feature-based detection model to identify laundering networks.  
- Utilize machine learning techniques to classify laundering and non-laundering accounts.  
- Analyze real-world operational data from Tencent QQ, one of the largest OSNs with over 861 million active users.
